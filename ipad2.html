                The iPad 2 is a tablet designed, developed and marketed by Apple Inc.
                 Compared to the first iPad, as the second model in the iPad line, it gained a faster dual core A5 processor, a lighter build structure with a flat, 
                 rather than curved, back, and was the first iPad to feature VGA front-facing and 720p rear-facing cameras designed for FaceTime video calling.
